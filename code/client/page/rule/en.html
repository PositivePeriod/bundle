BUNDE Rule
Two players each start with 5 pieces
Each piece can move one space to the left, right, and front if the arrival space is empty
A Bundle means a set of pieces connected up, down, left and right.

When it's your turn, you must take two actions
1. Move one pieces from the bundle chosen by your opponent in the previous turn
If all the pieces in the bundle are immobile, it's called isolated
All pieces of the isolated bundle replaced with empty squares and cannot be used
In the same turn, players who have lost any piece must move one of the remaining their pieces as they want

If there are no pieces left or no pieces that can move, you lose.
2. Choose one of your opponent's bundles to determine which one to use in the next turn

A base means the set of places(horizontal lines) where your piece are placed at the beginning
You wins if the opponent lose all pieces or at least one of your pieces arrives at the opponent's base
